# Get the rank of the process and the size of the communicator
rank = MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank
size = MPI.COMM_WORLD.size

# Split the communicator into even-sized groups
color = rank % 2
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Split(color, rank)

# Print the rank and size of the new communicator
print(f"Process {rank}: color = {color}, rank = {comm.rank}, size = {comm.size}")

#  This can be useful in a variety of situations where we want to group processes 
#  together for more efficient communication or to perform collective operations.

#  One common use case for MPI.COMM_WORLD.Split() is in load balancing applications,
#  where we want to divide the workload among multiple groups of processes. 
#  By splitting the communicator based on some criteria, such as the current load 
#  on each process, we can create groups of processes that have similar workloads and 
#  can therefore perform work more efficiently. This can lead to faster execution 
#  times and better performance overall.
