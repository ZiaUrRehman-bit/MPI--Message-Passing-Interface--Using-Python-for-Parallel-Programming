# MPI Python Basics

MPI Python (Message Passing Interface Python) is a Python library that provides an interface for message passing between processes in parallel computing. It allows programmers to write parallel programs that can run on distributed memory systems, clusters, or supercomputers.

MPI Python is based on the MPI standard, which is a widely used standard for message passing in high-performance computing. The library provides a set of functions that allow programmers to send and receive messages between processes, synchronize processes, and perform collective operations like broadcast and reduce.

MPI Python is commonly used in scientific computing, where large-scale simulations and data analysis require the processing power of multiple computing nodes. With MPI Python, programmers can write parallel programs in Python, a high-level language known for its ease of use and readability.

MPI Python is available as a module in most Python distributions, and it can be installed using tools like pip. The library is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, and it supports various MPI implementations like OpenMPI, MPICH, and Intel MPI.
