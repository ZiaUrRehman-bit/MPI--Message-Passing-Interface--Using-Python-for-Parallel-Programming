# MPI Python Basics

MPI Python (Message Passing Interface Python) is a Python library that provides an interface for message passing between processes in parallel computing. It allows programmers to write parallel programs that can run on distributed memory systems, clusters, or supercomputers.

MPI Python is based on the MPI standard, which is a widely used standard for message passing in high-performance computing. The library provides a set of functions that allow programmers to send and receive messages between processes, synchronize processes, and perform collective operations like broadcast and reduce.

MPI Python is commonly used in scientific computing, where large-scale simulations and data analysis require the processing power of multiple computing nodes. With MPI Python, programmers can write parallel programs in Python, a high-level language known for its ease of use and readability.

MPI Python is available as a module in most Python distributions, and it can be installed using tools like pip. The library is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, and it supports various MPI implementations like OpenMPI, MPICH, and Intel MPI.

# mpi4py Python Library

* **pip install mpi4py**

**mpi4py** is a Python library that provides bindings for MPI (Message Passing Interface), which is a standard for parallel computing. MPI allows multiple processes running on different processors to communicate with each other and work together on a shared problem.

The mpi4py library allows Python programmers to write parallel programs using MPI. It provides a Python interface to the MPI standard, so you can use MPI functions and data types directly from Python.

Some of the key features of mpi4py include:

* **''mpi4py is a Python wrapper for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, which is a widely-used library for parallel programming in high-performance computing (HPC). It allows you to use MPI in your Python programs to parallelize computations and perform other types of interprocess communication.''**

* **The mpi4py package provides a number of functions and classes that you can use to implement parallel algorithms in Python. It provides a Comm class that represents an MPI communicator, which is an object that provides a way for processes to communicate with each other. You can use the Comm class to create new communicators, split existing communicators, and perform various other operations.**

* **The mpi4py package also provides a number of functions that you can use to send and receive data between processes. For example, you can use the send() and recv() functions to send and receive data using point-to-point communication, or the gather() and scatter() functions to perform collective communication.**

* **Finally, mpi4py provides a number of utility functions that you can use to perform various operations, such as finding out the size of a communicator, the rank of a process, or the number of processes in a communicator.**

* **Overall, mpi4py is a useful package for writing parallel programs in Python that can take advantag''**
